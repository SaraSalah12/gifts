          Choosing the right gift for people in their various relationships is not an easy thing, as it constitutes a great confusion for the person who wants to give the gift often, and in order for the gift to achieve all the desired goals of presenting it, there are some tips that may be useful in determining the appropriate gift, including the following: <br>
           Determining the desired message of the gift, before starting to think about the quality and choice of the gift, it is necessary to determine the nature of the relationship between the two parties, the Mahdi and the gifted to him, and what is the message that the first party wants to convey to the second party, for example if someone wants to gift a gift to his colleague at work He wishes to express feelings of appreciation for his efforts at work and his cooperation with him, and if a person wishes to present a gift to his neighbor, he wishes to express his gratitude for his good neighborliness, and this may greatly help in limiting the quality of gifts and excluding inappropriate gifts. <br>
            Studying the other party The choice of the gift depends on important matters such as gender. <br>
             A gift given to a female is different from a gift given to a male; Because each of them has its own composition, and its different nature, and the interests of women usually differ from the interests of men, a man may be happy when giving him the shirt of his favorite football player, while the female may not prefer such a gift, and the things that attract the female are different from the things that attract the man, so is the age One of the things that must be taken into account when choosing a gift, human interests change with age, children usually love games and things related to animation, while young people prefer everything new in the world of fashion and fashion.
        <br>Hobbies of the other party The different human relationships and coexistence with the people around him allow him to get close to them and know some of their personal matters, such as: their favorite hobbies, interests, and matters that attract their attention, and this knowledge depends on the depth of the relationship of the two parties, and it may be distinctive to choose a gift based on hobbies The other party, for example, can give a book to someone who loves to read, or a special set of pens can be gifted to a person who loves to write. <br>
         Asking about the gift he prefers In most cases, the relationship between the two parties is a fraternal relationship and there are no barriers, then there is no objection to asking in a friendly and gentle manner about the gift that the second party desires, as he may need something specific and feel embarrassed to ask for it, then the gift is appropriate It achieved the goal of its gift and fulfilled the recipient's need. Choosing a Charitable Gift Many people are interested in charitable work and have a passion to help everyone, and a charitable gift may make them more happy than any other gift, such as: an invitation card to a seminar related to something he cares about, or a donation to a charitable organization with which he sympathizes and adopts its ideas. </p>
